.. Windowing!
.. Include kurtosis for all features
.. Covariance for mfccs, sbscs
.. MFCCs from 40-11000Hz instead of 0-11000Hz
Mention neighborRatio and staticDistribution parameters. Use the same symbols as in the cited ref and say that you're doing so explicitly.
.. Upper and lower freq bounds in computing HS features, how is N_H determined? Min energy threshold?
Formulaes and parameters for other spectral features
Details for classifiers: parameters
Information gain inside the cross fold validation scheme.
Statistical significance!
